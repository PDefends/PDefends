This lab demonstrates how I set up a virtual machine using **Hyper-V** on Windows 11 Pro and installed **Ubuntu 22.04.3**.

### 🛠️ What I did:
- Opened **Hyper-V Manager** on ACIWIN11
- Created a **Generation 2** virtual machine
- Assigned **2048MB RAM** and **25GB virtual hard disk**
- Connected the VM to the **Default Switch** for basic networking
- Selected the **Ubuntu 22.04.3 ISO**
- **Disabled Secure Boot** to ensure compatibility with Ubuntu
- Started the VM and completed the Ubuntu installation

### 📝 Notes & Observations:
- The **Default Switch** provides quick and easy internet access and host communication.
- **Hyper-V** is a **Type 1 (bare-metal) hypervisor**, even though it runs inside Windows.
- **Secure Boot must be disabled** to install most Linux distributions in Hyper-V.
