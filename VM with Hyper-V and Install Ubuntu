### What I Did
- Created a Generation 2 VM using Hyper-V on Windows 11  
- Assigned 2048MB RAM and a 25GB virtual hard disk  
- Connected to the Default Switch  
- Attached the Ubuntu ISO and disabled Secure Boot  
- Launched and completed Ubuntu installation  

### Notes
- The Default Switch provides internet access without extra configuration  
- Secure Boot must be disabled for Ubuntu to boot in Hyper-V  

> This VM shows a basic example of installing Ubuntu in a Hyper-V environment.  
> A useful process for setting up test labs or isolated environments.
