### 🛠️ What I Did:
- Opened **Hyper-V Manager** on ACIWIN11
- Created a **Generation 2** virtual machine
- Assigned **2048MB RAM** and **25GB virtual hard disk**
- Connected the VM to the **Default Switch** for basic networking
- Selected the **Ubuntu 22.04.3 ISO**
- **Disabled Secure Boot** to ensure compatibility with Ubuntu
- Started the VM and completed the Ubuntu installation

### 📝 Notes & Observations:
- The **Default Switch** provides simple, automatic networking for internet and host communication.
- **Hyper-V** functions as a **Type 1 (bare-metal) hypervisor**, despite running within Windows.
- **Secure Boot must be disabled** when installing most Linux distributions via Hyper-V.
