### ðŸ”§ What I Did:
- Created a **Generation 2** VM using Hyper-V on Windows 11
- Assigned `2048MB RAM` and `25GB` virtual hard disk
- Connected to the **Default Switch**
- Attached the Ubuntu ISO and disabled Secure Boot
- Launched and completed Ubuntu installation

---

### ðŸ“Œ Notes:
- Default Switch gives internet access without complex setup
- Secure Boot must be disabled for Ubuntu to boot in Hyper-V

> This VM shows a basic example of installing Ubuntu in a Hyper-V environment. A useful process for setting up test labs or isolated environments in the future.
