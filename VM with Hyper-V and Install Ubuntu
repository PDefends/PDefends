### 🔧 What I did:
- Opened **Hyper-V Manager** on ACIWIN11
- Created a **Generation 2** virtual machine
- Assigned **2048MB RAM** and **25GB virtual hard disk**
- Connected the VM to the **Default Switch** for basic networking
- Selected the **Ubuntu 22.04.3 ISO**
- **Disabled Secure Boot** to ensure compatibility with Ubuntu
- Started the VM and completed Ubuntu installation

### 📝 Notes & Observations:
- The **Default Switch** is useful for quick internet access and communication between the VM and the host.
- Hyper-V may appear like an app, but it functions as a **Type 1 (bare-metal) hypervisor**.
- **Secure Boot must be disabled** in Hyper-V when installing most Linux distributions.

This setup provides a basic knowledge of how to install Ubuntu using Hyper-V, useful for future virtualization tasks.
